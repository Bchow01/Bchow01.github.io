        </h1>
        <h2>
            The best neighborhood is Sunset
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because I know the area well, and you can go to the beach and watch the <em> sunset</em>.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The worst neighborhood is Mission
        </h2>
        <p>
            It has a <strong> high crime rate </strong>.

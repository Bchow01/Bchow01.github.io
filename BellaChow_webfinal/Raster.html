    <h2>What I learned...</h2>
        <p>I did learn Photoshop before, the very basic, so i was familiar with some of the tools. Since we haven't learned vecotr yet when i was working on this project it was hard to get the text to curve in a certain direction. For this project, i wanted to show three animals going on a journey together.

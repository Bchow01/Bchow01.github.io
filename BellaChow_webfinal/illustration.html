    <h2>What I learned...</h2>
        <p> I never worked with <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> before so this was my first project using the software. For this project I wanted to draw a rabbit holding a a big card welcoming or advertising her cafe. The hard part of the project was drawing the rabbit, because as I am drawing parts of the rabbit and putting it together my layers start to get messy, so i learned try be as organize as possible as you start out. In the end, it kind of look like what I imagine though in my mind the rabbit looked more cute than what i drawn xD

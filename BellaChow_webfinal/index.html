    <h3>About me...</h3>
    <p> Hi. My name is Bella and this my first year at City College. I am majoring in Marketing and want to learn more about graphic design as it is becoming a important part for the job. For this semester, I am taking three intro course to graphic design and I am enjoying all the classes and to me is more fun than sitting through three hour math course.

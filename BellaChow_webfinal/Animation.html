    <h2>What I learned...</h2>
        <h3>Three bunnies audition for a dance performance, but failed and.........</h3>
        <p> I knew making a animated films was a hard process, but I didn't understand how hard it is until i made one myself. A 10 second movement can me up to 30minutes to an hour to make. In the end, this took me like almost or more than 10 hours to do with trail and error. However, made a mistake with sound, so couldn't get it to play.
